#### Goal
A full-fledged baseball game and simulator based on real MLB players and driven by real data converted into game stats. Would feature a play now mode in addition to others such as simulations based on the current MLB season.

## Installation
Make sure you have [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org) installed on your computer and that the pod is initialized in the Homework folder. When opening the project, make sure you open the .xcworkspace file and NOT the .xcodeproj file. By default, the app loads the current year's roster as an example. This app uses the following pods:
* [DownloadButton]() - download button
* [Hpple]() - website parsing
* [MGSwipeTableCell]() - cells with swipe menus
* [UCZPogressView]() - download progress
* [ZFDragableModalTransition]() - popup views
* [Core Data]() - on-device data storage
